**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

The most interesting topic covered was upscaling raster data from finer to coarser grids and exploring how different upscaling techniques affects the quality of the upscaling. 

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**

A potential investigation I would like to pursue is seeing how well LLMs / Agents can perform in modeling wildfires and risk. With the significant use of AI technology today, it would be interesting to see how AIcan be leveraged to model wildfires and risk.

**What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

A potential change I would like to is being more proactive and direct with my mentors in setting goals, getting data, and recieving the project outline way sooner so that we are not behind like we are in Quarter 1.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**

Modeling per-minute spread of wildfires given physical and geospatial data and potentially using real time imagery as additional information would be interesting.
